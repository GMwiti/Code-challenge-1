# GRADE SYSTEM
the grade system has used logical operator &&, a function and if and if else as javascript components to complete the system. The function allows the system to easily be reused without writing the code over and over again. The logical operator && was used because it is strict therefore making our range fixed and basically making the marks we put fit into the ranges provided therefore providing the most fitting grade. The if and if else allows us to make multiple ranges hence all encompassing marks from 0 - 100

# SPEED DETECTOR
Our speed detector used if and else if as well as a function as our javascript components.The function allows the detector to easily be reused without writing the code over and over again. We also used the calculation (speed - limit) divided by five in order to calculate the demerit points.Then by using if and else if we made a range that allowed us to know after how many demerit points will the license be suspended

# NET - SALARY CALCULATOR
Our net - salary calculator has used two functions , five variables and a number of calculations.The functions allows the calculations to easily be reused without writing the code over and over again.The first function is used to calculate the gross pay by using the taxable amount (which is per annum) as well as the rates provided to deduct the gross tax and therefore give us the gross pay.The gross pay was stored in a variable in order to use it in the second function to get our NHIF deductions.The if and else if was very important in allowing us to put strict brackets where our values are correctly sorted into the right bracket thus giving us the correct tax.The use of logical operator && cannot go unnoticed since it is fundamental in keeping our brackets intact and sorting values into the right calculations.By combining all our values into one equation at the end simplifies our code and allows us to easily console.log to get the results
